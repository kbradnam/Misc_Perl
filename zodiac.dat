Now is a good time to live life in the fast lane and be daring and bold. Try wearing one less item of clothing than usual.

The rabbit that runs twice as fast, eats twice as slow. Don't be the rabbit that wins a race but ends up hungry.
Clouds are on the horizon. Storm clouds. Storm clouds that will bring rain, hail, thunder, and lightning. Run away.
Even a tiny fly can stop a bullet, if its wings are made of steel.
There is no difference between what you can do and what you think you can do. The only difference is in your mind, or what you think is in your mind.
Walk briskly this week, because the winds of opposition will try to slow you down. Break through the winds to achieve success, only by breaking wind will you find happiness.
Is there a door opening up in your life? If so then close it, or at most leave it only slightly ajar.
There may be times this week when you will wonder if you will ever make it to Friday unscathed. If you survive until Thursday evening, then you will be fine.
This will be a good week for fun, festivities, and especially fashion. Let your clothes do the talking and don't skimp on the accessories.
Food may be important for you this week, so it might be preferable if you try eating it.
Eat well this week, but don't eat too little, and don't eat too much. Also avoid the wrong types of food and focus on the right types of food.

Think of all the great things that might happen to you this week. They may never happen, but at least you're thinking about them.
If you were a vegetable, you'd probably be a tomato. Watch that you don't get squashed this week.
If there was ever a week to shut the curtains, stay in bed, and hide under the duvet like a frightened kitten, then this is the week...unless you need to go out.
Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Sad. Sad. Sad. Which one of these will you be this week?
You can dance this week if you think that kicking up your heels will make you happier. By the way, it won't.
Love is all around you this week. You will feel it in your fingers. You will feel it in your toes.
You've set your sights high this week, but as the Chinese proverb warns us 'rain always dampens an egg buried in the ground'.
There are many things that you would like to try this week. But remember 'do or do not, there is no try'.
Confront your inner demons this week and arrange for an internal exorcism. 
Are you happy? Are you sad? Are you content? Are you restless? The answers to 3 of these questions will not be revealed this week.
You think that someone is out to get you, you think that they want to see you squashed like a bug. You are wrong. They are wrong. Everyone is wrong.
Smile like a bumblebee in June, and you will be rewarded for your happiness.
A hairy man (or woman) will provide you with a bristly problem this week.
Put some distance between you and a rival. At least @number@ feet, but no more than a mile.

@day@ afternoon (about 3:15) is the time for making a big decision about your life.
If you keep putting it off (and you know what I mean by 'it'), it will never get done. Sort it out this week once and for all.
A trip to the dry-cleaners could provide the impetus you have been looking for to kick-start your business plans.
Why do people infuriate so much? Could it be because they are all idiots? Probably.
Nobody seems to recognize your genius. You are a jumbo shrimp in a sea of clams.
Others will spend this week trying to think outside the box. Show them your true genius by turning the box inside out and then thinking inside it.
You work hard but seem to get no reward for your effort. Perhaps this week, you will get effort for your reward.
Be careful not to overexert yourself in the kitchen this week. Remember, too many broths spoil the cook.
If there was ever a week in which you should enroll in a foreign language class, then this is the week.
Tiredness will knock on your door this week, so be prepared to consume vast amounts of energy drinks.
Is there a ray of light at the end of the tunnel? A chance meeting on @day@ with a gynecologist might provide some answers.
You are being driven mad by driving. Don't get mad, get even.
If you ever wanted to place a bet on a big race, then this is the week. A horse whose name begins with the letter G will win big.
Take a second look at what you are wearing. Your friends think that it is time that you burn your wardrobe. Maybe they are right?
You are a genius, only no-one knows it. Maybe you should try telling people.
A foreign fish will play an exciting role in your life this week.
Big developments will occur in the bedroom this week. Make sure your sheets are clean.

Don't take no for an answer, especially when rancid dairy products are involved.
You have been thinking recently, 'is this the best I can do?'. The answer, sadly, is 'yes'.
Why do you spend so much time waiting for other people to tell you how great you are. Cut out the middle man and start singing your own praises while looking in the mirror.
Life is good at the moment, so be careful not to ruin it all becoming addicted to gambling.
Fish are a big thing in your life at the moment. Catching fish and eating fish are what you are all about.
You are a fighter, not a quitter. Don't let the bastards grind you down.
Why is everyone so keen on cheese these days? You know that steering clear of the yellow stuff is the right thing to do.
A friend in need is a friend indeed...except when they cheat on you behind your back. Keep a careful eye out on those that call themselves your 'friends'.
Ever had to take over the controls of a plane due to an injury to the pilot? This week might provide an occasion to do just that.
Running away from things will not help problems this week. Neither will staying where you are.
Happiness. Happiness. Happiness. Happiness. Happiness. It's a happy week!

Walk faster than the person in front of you if you want to get ahead this week...unless that person is carrying a knife.
Time to remove the 'us' in fuss and put the 'me' in 'medicate'.
If you stayed in bed *all* week...maybe nobody would know that you were missing.
Take heed of the old sailors warning 'If you drown, you die'.
Ancient mariners used to say that spotting a whale traveling westwards on a Wednesday, meant that you would suffer a bodily discharge on Thursday. Heed these words.
A sailor that can't sail is not a sailor. Likewise a thinker that can't think is not a thinker. Are you a sailor or a thinker?
It could be a good time this week to heed the warning 'clams, fireworks, and alcohol do not mix well'.
A famous sailor once said "You can kiss a mermaid, but you might still die of scurvy"...these words will have special significance for you this week.
Are olives really 'the Devil's grape'? This is the week where you will find out.
As the old saying goes 'You can hide a shrimp under a shell, but it's still a shrimp, just a shrimp under a shell'. Heed these words this week, especially if you have any run-ins with the police.
If you smoke, then this is a good week to give up. If you don't smoke, then maybe this is a good week to try.
A famous fisherman once noted that while five fish will always feed a family of four, four fish might not feed a family of five. These words will have special meaning for you this week.
Your friends will tell you that you have to make up your mind regarding your big problem. They will tell you that you must sink or swim. Remember though,that there is a third option. Try to achieve a state of neutral buoyancy.
Belief is the key to your problems this week. Belief in the power of a burning flame. Belief in the strength that can only come from catching three green lights in a row. Belief in the proverb that 'Even a lost penguin will find its way home'. It's time to believe.
Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork. The more you finish, the more just keeps piling up on your desk. The solution to your office stress is to buy a box of matches...the rest will become obvious.
A famous sailor once remarked that 'A beached whale is like a boy urinating in a church at a wedding. It doesn't look good, it doesn't smell good, and everyone pretends not to notice, even though they are secretly annoyed. Don't be that beached whale.
A religious fanatic with a speech impediment will cause you much grief this week.
An important financial decision could prove disastrous if you fail to properly understand the intricacies of global macro-economics. Enhance your chances of success by relying on the time-tested tradition of flipping a coin. Heads means 'Buy' and tails means 'Sell'.
Sexual tensions will be further inflamed this week by an inappropriate use of office stationary.
This might be the sort of crazy week where you should try to do the exact <b>opposite</b> of what everyone tries to tell you to do. One exception to this would be if anyone tells you to do the opposite of what you would normally do.
Make sure that you heed the old maritime warning this week: "When whales swim in threes, flatulence comes for thee".
One of the following objects will potentially cause you to have a life-altering event this week: a red car, an unripe avocado, @day@'s edition of your local newspaper, or a vibrating electronic device.
Mishearing the phrase 'Mass perturbation' will prove your undoing this week. Have your excuses at the ready.
It may not make much sense now, but carry an opened umbrella with you on Wednesday (whatever the weather) and you will be thankful that you did.
A man connected with the number @number@ will potentially have a healing effect on your 'little problem' that's been bothering you.
The number @number@ will be a powerful omen for you this @day@, but only if you are in the possession of some dried fruit.
Should you find yourself in a casino this week, then the number @number@ might be the key to a little financial surprise (the surprise might involve the words 'your credit card is no longer valid' so be careful).
A pretty young woman connected to the number @number@ will be involved in a bizarre gardening accident this week. You may or may not know this woman.
Avoid the number @number@ if possible on @day@. The reason for this is unclear, but as a wise sailor once said "I don't mind being swallowed by a whale...as long as I pass out the other end".
Try to spend one day this week in silence. Communicate only with gestures or bodily odors.
Eat, drink, and be merry. But not if you are driving or are a recovering alcoholic. In which case you should just eat.
The number @number@ will have special significance on @day@, but sadly you will never realize just what that significance is, and so it will all be a bit wasted on you.
If you have a pet llama, then you should try to avoid wearing red on @day@. This may seem an unreasonable request, but you really want the violent and bloody death of an innocent llama on your conscience?
Take the time to make some sense of what you want to say. And cast your words away upon the waves. 
If you wear too much make-up on @day@, you could be in for trouble when someone close to you mistakes you for someone even closer to them.
Your watch is making you a prisoner to time. Destroy it. Break it. Smash it up. Be free from the restrictions of a time-delimited schedule...unless you have an important meeting this week.
They say that you should never comment on a woman's age. Maybe you should try to do it this week to see if that saying still holds true.
Avoid cheesecake at all costs this week, except on @day@ where a small slice of cheesecake will be tolerable (but not if it contains unripened fruit).
A CD will be released this week, a CD that you have been waiting a long time to see. You must *never* buy this CD. If you buy it, you will become more unpopular than you can possibly imagine.
See a penny, pick it up, and all day long you'll have good luck...or will you???
It is written that 'a drunken sailor is a happy sailor', yet it is also written that 'drinking leads to death'. Which one of these sayings do you most believe in?
The ship of your dreams is sailing down the river of despair. It's time to take hold of the tiller of fate, and steer yourself to the calm waters of your future.
If you spot a dead whale (or other cetacean) this week, then beware! This is an omen, an omen of death...or possibly a big sale at your local fish market.
A ship needs a rudder, a ship needs a captain, and a ship needs appropriate health and safety information. Who is the captain of your ship, and who has their hand on the rudder? And most importantly, do you have a life-jacket?



# Barnacle,December 2nd - February 19th
You may want to keep a fellow clam close to your side on @day@.
Watch out for someone saying 'no' to you this week.
Time to get it on with someone this week. It only really matters if they have a pulse.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't give in to the idiots who are wrong.
Beware an advance from a limpet this week. They will cling to you like an alcoholic clings to a bottle of cheap whiskey.

Your enemies might tell you that you are not a proper mollusk this week, i.e. that you don't belong in society. Ignore them and you will be more of a mollusk than they could ever be.
A old Snail associate will cross your path this week...very slowly. Be patient, this Snail will provide you with much needed culinary relief.
A collision with a Limpet will literally knock you off your feet this week. Don't spend much time arguing whose fault it was but instead try to reach a consensus that it was due to a stupid Slug that you know.
There is a Clam on the war-path, and that Clam is heading your way. Make like a dead whale, and play dead.
Beware the old saying: 'a squid in need is a squid indeed'. It might make no sense, but then again neither does the weather.
This week, you should heed the old nautical expression 'See a Slug, hear a Slug, smell a Slug, hit a Slug'.
This is the week where you will need an Oyster by your side, but there will be none to be found. If you get desperate then try searching at either a bar, brothel, or baptism ceremony. These are all natural haunts for the Oyster.


# Snail,February 20th - March 9th
If you see a barnacle this week, you should probably hit them. They are always trouble.
Limpets are losers so avoid them this week.
You know a clam who deserves to be punched...twice!
Avoid roller-coasters at *all* costs on @day@.
This is certainly a week where if you see a slug, then you should given them a punch on the chin.

If you were a shrimp then you would be an outcast among your Mollusk friends. But you are no shrimp, you are a Snail, and don't you ever forget it!
A Limpet you know well, a new carpet, and a weak bladder will combine with tragic consequences this week.
There is a Clam that is going to do something to you this week which will annoy you greatly. But be prepared by buying a good quality stain remover ahead of time.
A squid will get in your way this week. If you are in a car, then it is fine to run them down.
Stupid is as stupid does, and as stupidity goes, a run in on @day@ with a Slug will have you reaching for your gun (metaphorically). Shoot down the Slug (metaphorically speaking) before they shoot down your dreams.
When a Snail and an Oyster meet, it is a bit like finding a dead animal in your washing machine. However much you try, the smell just won't go away.
On @day@, walk into the nearest bar after you have finished work and find a friendly Scallop to talk to. If you do not know anyone there, then so much the better.



# Limpet,March 10th - May 1st
Meet up with an oyster for a fun time on @day@.
Get your friends to form a circle around you, then they can clap and cheer at your brilliance.
Get your creative juices flowing and write a poem about your favorite cheese.
If you are not in the spotlight this week, then you bloody well should be.
Meet up with a squid this week for some fun and frolics...beware that alcohol and silicon-based lubricants may be involved.

Take a trip to your local art gallery and prepare to be moved by an unusual pasta-based sculpture.
A Clam in your immediate family will cause trouble by revealing all about your dark secret involving the hamster.
Why do Squids have that annoying habit of saying something at the most inopportune times. If you are speaking at any event this week where there is an opportunity to ask questions, then avoid fielding any such questions from a Squid.
When a Slug comes calling at your door, asking for a little financial favor, tell them in no uncertain terms: "You are a poor excuse for a mollusk, and I would rather force-feed myself to a shark than lend you any money".
You are a good Mollusk, you are a trustworthy Mollusk. So why when an Oyster comes calling at your door on @day@ will you be doubting yourself? I don't know. Do you?
Ever been on holiday with a Scallop before? They'll buy you a lot of drinks but they'll expect certain favors in return. You might not like the sound - or the smell - of those favors.
Sometimes you will try hard to avoid them, you will try your best to pass them by in the street or workplace. But on @day@ there is no escape. You will have to go toe-to-toe with an Octopus. Make sure you have an adequate supply of breath mints.


# Clam,May 2nd - June 2nd
You know a squid who is in trouble this week. Time for a bit of clam-support.
Whatever anyone says to you, it's not worth telling your boss about.
Remember, your lips are sealed.
You would rather stick a knife in your eye than disclose a less than important secret to your boss.
Hook up with an octopus on @day@ if you want to see a good time that doesn't involve ambulances.

A squid in need is a squid indeed. This is the week to hang out with your squid buddy and see what pops out of the toaster.
Hook up with a Squid this week in order to relieve those bedroom tensions. Try to avoid using tinned fruit though.
You have a few personal problems at the moment and you might feel that you should turn to a colleague for advice. But asking a Slug for advice is like stepping into a bath full of kerosene and then lighting a firework.
There is an Oyster in town who is looking for a good time. You can join in that good time, but be prepared to run up an substantial credit-card bill, and don't expect to see your shoes again anytime soon.
Get out and enjoy life on @day@, and if you happen to spot a little Scallop who is in need of a good time then so much the better. But remember: Clams and Scallops, good. Clams and Scallops and alcohol, bad.
If you put a Clam and an Octopus together, it is a bit like Laurel and Hardy. There will be much stupidity and much clumsiness. There will also be a lot of pain.
Get in a tussle with a Mussel and they will feel the slam of a Clam.


# Squid,June 3rd - July 25th
If a barnacle, oyster, or mussel says anything to you at all this week, don't believe them.
If you have to lie about your age, height, weight, or gender this week, then it's probably for the best.
Tell someone that they look great...even if they are pig ugly.
Try applying for a passport using a false identity. It might not work, you might be arrested, but it might be fun trying.
You might know of a slug who is in trouble this week. But as they are a slug, you probably won't want to help them.

You may be asked your age this week by a close business colleague...they may be trying to get you into trouble so you should probably lie.
You will see a Slug in trouble this week. You will not care. You are the better Mollusk.
When you and that lovable Oyster colleague of yours get together, then sparks will fly. Unfortunately, that might lead to a charge of arson this week, so best cancel that @day@ night get-together.
Get together for a Scallop this week if you want to have a fun time that involves an activity that is not yet illegal in all countries.
Throw yourself into the (many) arms of an Octopus this week and you will find out whether what they say about an Octopus in an elevator is true.
If you have the time, try to track down a trustworthy Mussel that you know on @day@. Tell them a big secret and see how trustworthy they really are.
Bless your barnacles, for a Barnacle will come to save the day for you on @day@. You would have never guessed that peanut butter would prove so useful.


# Slug,July 26th
Your miserable existence will take a further turn for the worse this week, so be prepared to sink to new lows.
Why do you try so hard, when everything you do fails?
Now is not the time to shed a tear. Now is the time to weep uncontrollably.
You have tried so hard, and accomplished so little. Now is the time to give up.
Your friends talk about you behind your back. Are they pathetic...or are you?
Everything you try to achieve ends up being surrounded in failure, perhaps you should consider early retirement?
You have nothing to offer anyone this week, so it's business as usual.
Too many cooks spoil the broth, but if you are making the broth, then you will spoil it all by yourself.
There is an elephant in the room. You are the elephant.
In a week where everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, you just have to accept that this is largely your fault.
Have you looked outside recently? If you have you will have noticed that it has been dull and gloomy for some time. A bit like you.
You can cry, you can weep, you can rant and rage, you can demand attention. You can do all of these things and more, but the bottom line is that maybe you deserve it.
There will be good news on Wednesday this week. However, it will turn out to be very bad news by Friday.
Be careful what you choose to eat this week...there is a lot of food poisoning about.
Romance looms large this week. But not for you unfortunately.
This week, you should be wary of the hapless idiot...especially when the idiot in question is you.
Have you ever truly been happy? Probably not.
Your friends will gather closely around you this week, so please take steps to lessen your foul odor.
You need to talk to people to tell them how you really feel about things. They desperately want to know how you feel. Well, maybe not desperately. Actually, they don't really want to know how you feel...or even if you are still drawing breath.
The sound of thunder will hang over you until you can put a smile on your face. As you are one of the most miserable people around, this may not be easy.
The person that you have a secret crush on does not feel the same way about you. If they knew how you truly felt, then they would probably be violently ill.
You might want to take a second look in the mirror at some point this week...just to confirm that you really are that ugly.
Remember, things can go only get better...actually for you they can probably still get quite a bit worse.
You need to go on a low-sodium diet to improve your health...pity this won't improve your looks though.
There is a chance that things will go well for you this week...remember though, there is also a chance that pigs might fly.
You may have heard of the saying "Don't worry, be happy"...well, that doesn't apply to miserable idiots like you.
A friend will come to you seek your advice on a sensitive subject this week. They will also come to deeply regret asking you about anything because your advice sucks.
You have dandruff, do something about it!
You may be feeling down. You may be feeling that nothing good ever happens to you. But don't worry. Just remember, that 99.9% of the rest of the population are much happier than you. So at least it all balances out!
Happiness. Joy. Financial success. Just another three things that you will not experience this week.
In your hour of need, an Oyster that you know will have all the answers to your problems this week. However, they are not going to tell you any of the answers.
You will receive a call this week with fantastic news about a possible love interest. Unfortunately, it will be a wrong number.
Hanging out with a Scallop on @day@ might gain you some attention as you bask in the aura of Mr/Mrs Popular. However, they will hate you for this unwanted association and your evening may well end with the threat of extreme physical violence.
With such a tragic life, with an existence full of misery, you may think you are a suitable candidate for the Guinness World Record of 'Most miserable life'. Don't think about applying for this record however...you will be rejected.
Life is looking good for you this week...actually, that's not exactly true. More likely, life is looking very bad for you.
Is it possible for everyone you know to violently dislike you? Yes. It is.
The number @number@ will be important for you this week. This will possibly be an amount of money that you will lose, or the number of days you might be held for questioning by the police.
A long lost family member will appear in your life once again this week. You will be overcome with emotion at meeting up with this person. That is until you find out that they have only tracked you down to ask you for money.
Days to avoid this week include Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Also Monday might be bad and Friday has an outside chance of being a miserable day. Wednesday is not looking too good either. But Tuesday will be ok...except if you have to talk to anyone in which case it will be a very bad day indeed.
If everything goes to plan this week then you will be a very happy Mollusk indeed. Chance are though, that it will fall to pieces...again!
Improve your popularity this week by a) not saying anything to anyone and b) wearing a bag over your head.
It's ok, your complete failure to achieve anything of significance in life is not entirely your fault...oh wait a minute, yes it is.
You will go to an auction on @day@. You will pay too much for something that you won't be able to sell and which you will take an instant disliking too the moment after you buy it. You are an idiot.
You will be followed about by a bad smell everywhere that you go this week. This is not much of a mystery, the smell is you.
This week your colleagues will be trying to heed the words of the old nautical expression 'If you see a Slug, run for your lives'.
Things will be mostly crap for you this week, but on the plus side of things, you will already know exactly what this feels like.
It's a tough life being a Slug. Nobody likes you, nobody wants to be around you, and nobody can stand your personal hygiene problems. Are you just misunderstood? Actually, no.



# Oyster,July 27th - August 19th
If the level of your confidence was a country, it would be Australia.
Get the guys or girls around your place on @day@ for a lurve fest.
Get some attention this week by wearing 7 items of clothing on Monday, and then remove an item each day
Does it really count as adultery if you don't tell anyone?
Invite a squid over this week for some mollusk-on-mollusk action.

Is is really vanity if you pay to put an advert in a national newspaper to point out to everyone how beautiful you are?
Take note of the old saying 'An Oyster and a Scallop is like quarterpounder and cheese...only without the cheese'.
You will get romantically entangled with an Octopus this week. They will regret it, but the quantities of alcohol involved mean that you won't remember anything so don't worry too much about it.
How many times do you get a Mussel trying to chat you up over a drink and a hot dog? Well this is the week where a Mussel with a point to prove will try to ply you with hot dogs and beer. Just go easy on the mustard!
Ever get stuck in an elevator with a Barnacle? Well be prepared for that eventuality on @day@. Also be prepared for a very bad body odor problem.
Ever hear the joke about the Oyster and the Snail who lived next door to each other. They drove each other to drink. Then they drove each other to hard drugs. Then they became the best of friends and started playing Scrabble together on a regular basis. Let that be a lesson to you (if you live next door to any Snails).
Do you know a Limpet? Do you <b>want</b> to know a Limpet? If the answer is yes, then on @day@ night make your way to where the cool people go. And take lots of loose change with you.


# Scallop,August 20th - October 1st
Beware, clams are plotting against you!
If someone offers you any food this week, then beware! It might be spiked with pepper.
Avoid the kung po chicken.
Your sex-life could be greatly improved by judicious use of peanut butter.
Go easy on the chili sauce this weak.

A clam you know will offer to cook for you this week. Be careful, they might have ulterior motives, and they will certainly try spiking your food with Tabasco sauce.
A distantly-related Octopus will offer an interesting opportunity to you this week. Whether to accept that offer will depend heavily on a) whether you trust your wife and b) how quickly you are prepared to learn Korean.
A female Mussel friend will give you something very precious this week, try not to blow the moment by commenting on her oversized rear.
You will come to the defense of a Barnacle this week when a common friend insults them for "not being a true Mollusk".
Take a Scallop and a Snail. Two very similar Mollusks who are also so entirely different. On @day@ you will find out just how similar or different you are when you will be inadvertently stuck in a toilet cubicle with said Snail.
On @day@ you might want to try playing Limpet limbo, but only if you know any sexually-charged Limpets. Otherwise stay at home with a good book.
A Clam that you know will try to kill you this week. Well maybe they are just plotting the act at this stage. Actually, they might only be thinking about it. On second thoughts, it's more of a vague intention. So don't worry about it too much. Just be careful around them if they are holding any sharp objects.


# Octopus,October 1st - October 29th
Someone will swear at you this week. You will not be happy.
You know which way is north and that ain't no lie.
If you hear so much as one mention of the F-word from a friend or colleague, then forcefully wash their mouth out with soap (or battery acid).
Tell a loved one that you are going to take up base jumping. You're not going to do this of course, but it's good to keep people on their toes.
Your map reading skills might just help you save a stranded puppy this week.

If you hear just one more person swear within a 20-foot radius of you, then it is time to tear up the map and get out of this town.
A portly Mussel that you work with will literally get in your way this week. You might want to tactfully suggest that the fat lump of lard should go on a diet.
You will find yourself in one of those situations where time is of the essence this week. However, a portly Barnacle involved in a roller-skating experiment is going to ensure that your scheduling goes out the window.
If a Snail tries buying your affections by spending vast amounts on money on you, then don't fall for it. It may make you happy, but happiness is not everything...at least not when the Snail in question has spent time inside for attempted manslaughter.
When you and a Limpet get together on @day@, sparks will literally fly. That's what you get when a chance encounter with a welder goes horribly wrong.
Turn up on time for a meeting with a Clam on @day@ and experience the 'Clocktopus Effect' - a beneficial outcome that will have arisen because you were on time.
When a Squid and an Octopus meet it's full-on tentacle action. So if you are out and about on @day@, then make sure you take enough moisturizer.



# Mussel,October 30th - December 1st
Tick tock, someone will be running late for a meeting with you. They are lazy fools.
To be on the safe side, arrive 5 hours early for your special work meeting this week.
You will kill yourself if you arrive late for work this week so purchase 7 alarm clocks to be on the safe side.
Make some sweet love in the afternoon...about 3:43 pm.
Remember, it is always better to arrive early. Arriving late is a sign of a drunken loser.

There is a time and a place for everything. This week, that time will more often that not be 8:22 am.
You will see a Barnacle in considerable distress this week. If they are left-handed, you should step in to help, otherwise keep walking.
A casual comment by a Snail acquaintance of yours might make you think twice before making that important purchase this week. Don't worry. As long as they have it in red, things will turn out just fine.
You will be asked to look after a Limpet this week. That may be a good thing but it may be a bad thing. Be especially careful on @day@ when said Limpet might ask you to do something which could be considered illegal in many countries.
'Wham, bam, thank you Clam'...that might be a motto for you to learn this week as Clam-antics in the bedroom will get you all worked up.
There is a Squid that you really like. There is a Squid that really likes you. Unfortunately they are half your age and live on the other side of the world.
You might be feeling low this week, things might not be going so well for you. There is a silver lining to your cloud of depression though. It could be worse, you could be a Slug.
